/* Linux thread local storage (TLS) support emulation
 *
 * Q: Why we need emulation?
 *
 * The working of Linux's TLS mechanisms is summarized as the following:
 * 1. A thread register a TLS area using set_thread_area() call with
 *    entry_number = -1. The system will allocate a TLS entry and fill the
 *    field when return. The entry number is actually an index into the
 *    system's GDT table.
 * 2. Other threads can allocate its own TLS area and using the same entry
 *    number returned by step 1 to register to the same TLS slot.
 * 3. When task switching occurs, the kernel will reload a thread's all TLS
 *    descriptors into GDT.
 * 4. When a thread needs to access TLS data, it just set gs register to the
 *    corresponding TLS entry number. Due to the GDT settings done on task
 *    switching, [gs:0] will always be the address of the current thread's
 *    registered TLS area. This way we can access any TLS data using mov
 *    instructions with virtually no cost.
 *
 * The Windows' way of TLS is slightly different:
 * 1. Internally Windows uses the fs register to store the "Thread Information
 *    Block" (TIB), which is a per thread structure and automatically switched
 *    on task switching. The TIB structure contains many data/flags for a
 *    thread. Beginning with [fs:e10h] there is a 256-slots area for storing
 *    thread local DWORD values.
 * 2. A thread first calls TlsAlloc() function to allocate an empty TLS slot.
 *    Then all threads can use TlsSetValue() and TlsGetValue() to set and
 *    retrieve its own local storage pointer.
 *
 * The good news is that Linux rarely uses the fs register, and on Windows
 * the gs register is unused. We won't get conflict on the use of these two
 * segment registers.
 * The bad news is when mimicing Linux TLS behavior is the need to add custom
 * entries into GDT and maintain them on context switch. Depending on the
 * version of Windows, this may or may not be possible:
 * 1. On all current versions of Windows, the GDT is unmodifiable by a user
 *    mode (ring 3) process.
 * 2. On 32-bit Windows, the GDT can only be modified by a kernel driver.
 *    However, a user mode process can use NtSetInformationProcess() or
 *    NtAddLdtEntries() to add custom LDT entries. We can assign a different
 *    LDT slot per thread/TLS entry and return a fake entry_number on
 *    set_thread_area() call. When user application move the entry number
 *    to gs a access violation exception will occur and we have a chance to
 *    set correct gs value.
 * 3. On 64-bit Windows, the LDT simply does not exist. Calling
 *    NtSetInformationProcess() and NtAddLdtEntries() will return
 *    NT_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Even with a driver, due to the protection
 *    made by the newly introduced PatchGuard, modifying the GDT will BSOD
 *    the system. So we need software emulation in this case.
 * Currently I only work on software emulation of TLS. The non-emulated
 * way for 32-bit Windows remains a TODO.
 *
 * Q: How to implement TLS?
 *
 * There are two flavor of approaches, one is emulation and another is
 * patching.
 * 1. Emulation
 * Keep gs to the zero value. This will cause an access violation on every
 * access related to gs. In the exception handler we can manually inspect
 * which instruction caused the violation and emulate that behavior. This
 * does not require any modifications to the executables. But as exception
 * handling is very expensive, this will not get good performance. Another
 * issue is on x86_64 systems, the Windows WOW64 runtimes seems to mess up
 * Win64 TEB pointer to gs register at context switches. This approach
 * will easily lead to crashes in this case.
 *
 * 2. Patching
 * Make patches for glibc which is (AFAIK) the only source for gs accesses.
 * Windows x86 TLS uses the fs segment register for storage. The location for
 * each TLS slot can be easily figured. Since the offset may change between
 * operating systems and we don't want to check this in glibc, we calculate
 * the offset here and pass it to glibc. Then at each TLS access we patch
 * glibc to use the fs segment register to first acquire the location of
 * the current TLS storage, then access its own TLS variables.
 *
 */

/* Notes for x64
 * On x64 one can directly set the base address of FS and GS segment register
 * through SWAPFS and SWAPGS instructions. A system call arch_prctl() is
 * provided for this purpose. Windowx uses GS register and glibc uses FS
 * register for TLS storage. We do not need to fake GDT/LDT stuff but only a
 * base address for the FS segment register.
